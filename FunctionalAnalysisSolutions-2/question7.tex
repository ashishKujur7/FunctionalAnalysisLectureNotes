 Let $X$ be a vector space and $\|\cdot\|_1$ and $\|\cdot\|_2$ are two norms on $X.$ Let $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ be the topology (that is the collection of all open set) associated to the  normed spaces $(X,\|\cdot\|_1)$ and $(X,\|\cdot\|_2)$ respectively. Show that $\|\cdot\|_1$ and $\|\cdot\|_2$ are two equivalent norms on $X$ if and only if $\tau_1=\tau_2.$

\begin{proof}[Solution]
    Let $\norm{}_{1}$ and $\norm{}_{2}$ be two norms on $X$ and let $\tau_{1}$ and $\tau_{2}$ be the respective topologies generated by $\norm{}_{1}$ and $\norm{}_{2}$.

    $\left( \Longrightarrow \right)$ Suppose that $\norm{}_{1}$ and $\norm{}_{2}$ be equivalent. To show that $\tau_{1}$ and $\tau_{2}$ are equivalent, it suffices to show that the basis of the topologies are equivalent, that every basis element of one topology contains a basis element of the other. But this follows immediately from the definition of the equivalent norms.

    $\left( \Longleftarrow \right)$ Lazy to write this down :(
\end{proof}

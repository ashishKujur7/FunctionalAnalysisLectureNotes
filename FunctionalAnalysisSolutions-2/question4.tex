Let $(X,\|\cdot\|)$ be a normed linear space and $Y$ be a proper subspace of $X$. Show that $Y^{\circ},$ the set of interior point of $Y$, is empty.

\begin{proof}[Solution]
    Let $Y$ be proper subspace of a normed linear space $X$. Suppose that the interior of $Y$ was nonempty. Then there exists $y\in Y$ and $r>0$ such that $B(y,r) \subset Y$. Since $Y$ is a subspace, we have that $B(0,r) \subset Y$. We now show that $X \subset Y$ which would contradict that $Y$ is a proper subspace of $X$. 

    Let $x\in X \setminus \left\{ 0 \right\}$. Then note that $\frac{r}{2} \frac{x}{\norm{x}} \in B(0,r)$ and  hence $\frac{r}{2} \frac{x}{\norm{x}} \in Y$. But then we have that $x \in Y$ because any $Y$ is a subspace and hence 
    \begin{align*}
	x= \frac{2\norm{x}}{r} \left( \frac{r}{2} \frac{x}{\norm{x}} \right) \in Y
    \end{align*}
    And we're done.
\end{proof}

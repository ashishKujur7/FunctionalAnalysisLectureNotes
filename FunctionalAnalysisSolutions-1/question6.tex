Let $(V,\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle)$ be an inner product space. Let $\overline{B(0,1)}$ denotes the closed unit ball in $V,$ that is, $$\overline{B(0,1)} = \{x\in V : \|x\|\leqslant 1\}.$$ Show that $\overline{B(0,1)}$ is compact if and only if dimension of $V$ is finite. \\
(Hint : if $\mathcal B = \{u_{\alpha} : \alpha\in I\}$ is a collection of orthonormal vectors in $V,$ then $\|u_{\alpha}-u_{\beta}\|=\sqrt{2}$ for  every $\alpha,\beta\in I$ and $\alpha \neq \beta.$ )

\begin{proof}[Solution]
    $\left( \Longleftarrow \right)$ Suppose that $\dim V$ is finite. In Lecture 5, we showed that $V$ is isometrically isomorphic to $\C ^{n}$ with Euclidean norm, that is, there exists a linear map $T: V \to \C^{n}$ which is an isometry. 
    Since every isometry is an homeomorphism\footnote{\href{https://planetmath.org/isometry}{proof here!}}, we have that $T^{-1} \left( \overline{B_{\C^{n}}\left( 0,1 \right)} \right) = \overline{B_{V} \left( 0,1 \right)}$. Since a continuous image of a compact set is compact, we have that $\overline{B_{V}(0,1)}$ is compact!

    $\left( \Longrightarrow \right)$ (Contrapositive proof) Suppose that $\dim V$ is infinite. Then by Zorn's Lemma, it has a maximal orthonormal set $\left\{ u_{\alpha} : \alpha \in I \right\}$. Since $V$ is an inner product space, we have that $\norm{u_{\alpha} - u_{\beta}} = \sqrt{2}$ for every $\alpha , \beta \in I$ with $\alpha \ne \beta$. Let $\left\{ e_{i} : i \in \N \right\}$ be any countable subset of $\left\{ u_{\alpha} : \alpha \in I \right\}$. Now, $\left\{ e_{i} \right\}_{i\in \N}$ is a sequence in $\overline {B(0,1)}$ but it cannot possibly have a convergent subsequence, hence, $\overline{B(0,1)}$ is not compact.
\end{proof}

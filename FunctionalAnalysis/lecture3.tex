\section{Lecture 3 --- \textit{Riesz Representation Theorem for Hilbert Spaces} --- 13th January, 2023}

\subsection{Lecture 2 continued \ldots}
Before we move onto prove the Riesz Representation Theorem, we finish the proof of Corollary \ref{cor:M-perp-perp}. It follows immediately from the following results:

\begin{proposition}[orthogonal complement of a set and the orthogonal completement of its closure are same!]
    Let $M$ be a subset of a inner product space $H$. Then $M^{\perp} =  \left( \overline{M} \right)^{\perp}$
    \label{prop:perp-and-closure-perp}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    It follows by definition that $M \subset \overline M$ and hence $\left( \overline M \right)^{\perp} \subset M^{\perp}$. Now for reverse the inclusion, let $v \in M^{\perp}$ and let $y \in \overline M$. We need to show that $\ip{v,y} = 0$. Since $y\in \overline M$ there is a sequence $\left( y_{n} \right)$ in $M$ such that $y_{n} \to y$. Since $v \in M^{\perp}$, we have that $\ip {v , y_{n}}=0 $ for all $n\in \N$. Since $\ip{v, y_{n}} \to \ip{v,y}$, we have by uniqueness of limits that $\ip{v,y} = 0$. This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[orthogonal complement of orthogonal complement]
    Let $M$ be a closed subspace of the Hilbert space $H$. Then 
    \begin{align*}
	M = \left( M^{\perp} \right) ^{\perp}
    \end{align*}
    \label{prop:o-comp-of-o-comp}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Let us first show that $M \subset \left( M ^{\perp} \right)^{\perp}$ (which in fact holds for any set $M$). Let $v \in M$ and $w \in M^{\perp}$. It is cleary by definition of $M^{\perp}$ that $\ip{v,w} = 0$. Hence, $v \in \left( M^{\perp} \right)^{\perp}$.

    Let us proceed to show the inclusion in the other direction. Let $v \in \left( M^{\perp} \right)^{\perp}$. Since $M$ is closed, by Theorem \ref{thm:existence-of-o-proj}, we have that $v = Pv + Qv$ where $Pv \in M$ and $Qv \in M^{\perp}$. By the previous paragraph, we have that $M \subset \left( M^{\perp} \right)^{\perp}$ and hence $Pv \in \left( M^{\perp} \right) ^{\perp}$. Hence, we have that $Qv \in \left( M^{\perp} \right)^{\perp}$. Now, $Qv \in M^{\perp} \cap \left( M^{\perp} \right) ^{\perp}$. Hence, $Qx = 0$ and thus, $v=Pv \in M$.
\end{proof}

Note that Proposition \ref{prop:perp-and-closure-perp} does not depend on $H$ being a Hilbert Space while Proposition \ref{prop:o-comp-of-o-comp} does!

Now, proof of Corollary \ref{cor:M-perp-perp} follows immediately:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Corollary \ref{cor:M-perp-perp}]
    The first part of Corollary \ref{cor:M-perp-perp} is basically Proposition \ref{prop:o-comp-of-o-comp}. Now to prove the second part, observe that
    \begin{align*}
    \left( M^{\perp} \right) ^{\perp} &= \left( \left( \overline M \right) ^{\perp} \right) ^{\perp} & \text{by Proposition } \ref{prop:perp-and-closure-perp} \\
    &= \overline{\overline{M}} & \text{by Proposition} \ref{prop:o-comp-of-o-comp} \\
    &= \overline M
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Existence of closed subspaces of Hilbert Spaces}
Let $H$ be a Hilbert space of dimension at least $1$. Does there always exist a closed subspace of $H$? The answer is \textit{Yes}!

Let us proceed to prove this: Let $H$ be any Hilbert space of dimension at least one. So, there is at least one nonzero vector $v$. Let $M$ be the subspace spanned by $v$. We show that $M$ is closed. Let $\left( y_{n} \right)$ be a sequence in $M$ converging to some $x \in H$.
By definition of $M$, we have that for every $n\in \N$, $y_{n} = c_{n}v$ for some $c_n \in \mathbb F$. We claim that $c_{n}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb F$.

To show that $\left( c_{n} \right)$ is Cauchy in $\mathbb F$, let $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Since $\left( c_{n} v \right)$ is convergent, it is Cauchy. So there is some $N \in \N$ such that for $n,m \ge N$, we have $\norm{c_n v - c_{m} v} < \norm{v} \varepsilon$. Which is turn implies that for $n,m \ge N$, $\abs{c_{n} - c_{m}} < \varepsilon$.

Now, since $\left( c_{n} \right)$ is Cauchy in $\F$, it must converge to some $c\in F$. Now, the sequence $\left( c_{n} v \right)$ converges to $cv$ in $M$ and by the uniqueness of limits, we have that $y=cv$ and hence $y\in M$.

This argument generalises, \textit{mutatis mutandis}, and the following result holds:
\begin{theorem}
    Every finite dimensional subspace of a inner product space is closed.
    \label{thm:fds-are-closed}
\end{theorem}

Let $V$ be a finite dimensional inner product space with inner product $\langle\cdot ,\cdot \rangle.$ Suppose $W$ is a subspace of $V$ and $\beta_k=(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k)$ is a ordered basis for $W.$ Let $y=v_{k+1}$ is a vector outside $W.$
\begin{center}
\textbf{A distance formula to keep in mind} (Proof not needed)
\end{center}
Then the distance of $v_{k+1}$ from $W$ is given by $d(v_{k+1},W)= \frac{\sqrt{\det G_{\beta_{k+1}}}}{\sqrt{\det G_{\beta_k}}},$ where $G_{\beta_k}$ and $G_{\beta_{k+1}}$ are the Grammian matrix associated to the vectors $\beta_k=(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k)$ and $\beta_{k+1}=(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k,v_{k+1}).$\\

{\textbf{Sketch of the proof}} : Volume of the k dimensional parallelepiped formed by the vectors in $\beta_k$ $\times \,\, d(v_{k+1},W) = $ Volume of the (k+1) dimensional parallelepiped formed by the vectors in $\beta_{k+1}.$


\textbf{Problem}
Let $\mathcal P_3$ be the vector space of all polynomials over $\mathbb R$ of degree less than or equal to $3,$ with the inner product 
\begin{align*}
\langle f,g\rangle = \int_{0}^1f(t)g(t)dt,\,\,f,g\in \mathcal P_3.
\end{align*} 
Let $\mathcal P_2$ be the subspace of  $\mathcal P_3$ given by the set of all polynomials over $\mathbb R$ of degree less than or equal to $2.$ Find the distance of $x^3$ from $\mathcal P_2.$

Consider $C[0,1],$ the space of all complex valued continuous function on the interval $[0,1],$ equipped with the supremum norm, $\|\cdot\|_{\infty},$ that is, $\|f\|_{\infty}=\sup_{x\in [0,1]} |f(x)|.$ Let $S$ be the subset
    \begin{equation*}
	S=\left\{ f \in C[0,1] \, : \, \int_{0}^{1/2} f\left( x \right) dx - \int_{1/2}^{1} f \left( x \right) dx =1 \right\}
    \end{equation*}
    Show that the set $S$ is closed and convex but the distance is never achieved. That is, there is no $f\in S$ such that $\|f\|_{\infty} = d(0,S)$.

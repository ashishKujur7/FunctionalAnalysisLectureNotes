Consider the normed linear space $(\mathbb R ^{2}, \|\cdot\|_1 ),$ where the the distance $d$ is given by 
\begin{align*}
d(x,y) = |x_1-y_1| + |x_2-y_2|,\,\,x=(x_1,x_2)\in \mathbb R^2, \,y=(y_1,y_2)\in \mathbb R^2.
\end{align*}
 Now consider the set $S= \{ ( x_{1} , x_{2}) : x_{1} + x_{2} =1 \}$. Show that the distance of the zero vector from $S,$ that is, $d(0,S)$  is achieved at infinitely many points in $S$.
